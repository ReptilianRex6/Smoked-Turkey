Your Turkey Brine (Balanced, Flavor-Packed, and Safe)

This works for a 12–20 lb turkey.

Brine Base

2 gallons of water (you can do half water, half apple cider if you want extra sweetness)

1 ½ cups kosher salt
(If using table salt, reduce to 1 cup—it's denser.)

2 cups brown sugar (solid)

2 apples, quartered

1–2 onions, quartered

3–4 celery stalks, rough chopped

6–8 garlic cloves, smashed

3–4 bay leaves

1 tablespoon black peppercorns

Fresh herbs if you have them: rosemary, thyme, sage (all optional but fantastic)


Optional Boosts

These deepen the flavor but aren't required:

1 cup apple cider or juice

1–2 tablespoons maple syrup (if not saving for butter glaze)

1–2 oranges, sliced

A splash of apple cider vinegar (½ cup, helps the brine penetrate)

The Method (easy version)

1. Heat 1–2 quarts of water in a big pot.
Add salt + sugar and stir until dissolved.


2. Add everything else (fruit, veggies, herbs).


3. Pour into a brining bucket or cooler, then add the rest of the cold water/ice until you get 2 gallons total.


4. Fully submerge the turkey.
If it floats, put a heavy plate on top.


5. Brine 12–24 hours in the fridge or a cooler kept cold with ice.
