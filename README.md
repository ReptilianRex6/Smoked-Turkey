**Perfect for 12-20 lb turkeys** | Balanced, Flavor-Packed, and Safe

### 💧 Brine Base

- **2 gallons** water (or half water, half apple cider for extra sweetness)

### ✨ Optional Boosts

These deepen the flavor but aren't required:

- 1 cup apple cider or juice
- 1-2 tablespoons maple syrup *(if not saving for butter glaze)*
- 1-2 oranges, sliced
- ½ cup apple cider vinegar *(helps the brine penetrate)*

### 📝 Brining Method

1. **Heat** 1-2 quarts of water in a large pot

2. **Add** all aromatics (fruit, veggies, herbs)

3. **Pour** into a brining bucket or cooler
